Hello This a Password Manager. It run on local host. I haven't deployed it yet. So, after downloading or copying the code they should be arranged in the exact same manner as in the repositories for it to work. I have added a Database (Flask-SQLAlchemy), here is the link for that https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/  So after downloading it you have to go to the location where your Python 3.12 is stored and open Command promt from there and type "pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy" and it will installed in few minutes. After that you can just open the file, enter the Command prompt compile it by typing "python main.py" and you will get a local host link (it looks something link this 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'). Press ctrl+Left mouse click and enjoy your password manager.
